With my arrow and bow
I leap at the scene of the battle field
With courage and strength
I seem ready for the hunt

The Kob rushes by
I fail to Target
deep inside my heart
Am afraid of the hunt

At the battlefield
Crushed are the small fish
Enslaved are the weak
Disregarded are the poor
But what can a common do

My eyes ache,
tears roll down;
The BiG fish lives,
Yet, in anguish
The powerless are left
Alas!!The hunt restrained.
